About FoodMNIST 

This data set consists of 10 food categories, with 5,000 images. For each class, 125 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 375 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.

I use 4 differences pre-trained CNN models to classify this dataset
